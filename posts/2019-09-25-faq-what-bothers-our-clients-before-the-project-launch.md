In our [previous article](https://issart.com/blog/faq-what-our-clients-want-to-know-before-signing-a-contract/) we covered the common questions we get from clients at the beginning of our negotiations. Today we will focus on the typical questions we get from clients who are willing to proceed with our team, and need to get a clear picture of how the workflow will look like.

Here you go.

##### 1. How do you typically communicate with your client during the development process? What communication channels are you using?

Our company understands the importance of Client's engagement into the project development. We have an established process in our project management department where an assigned project manager schedules and organizes meetings with a client.

We try our best to make Client feel like we are sitting next to him. We are always happy to make a voice call, as well as hold a video call. In addition, we try to minimize the inconveniences caused by time zone differences. When planning a meeting, we try to find the most convenient time slot for both parties.

We are quite flexible regarding the frequency of meetings. Actually, it depends on the project type and size, as well as the necessary level of Client's engagement into the development process.

On average, the updates are sent to Client at least twice a week via email, and the project demo presentations are held once in two weeks via Skype or Google Hangouts.

##### 2. How do you form a team for a certain project?

The project team is formed according to the expertise and experience of the specialists that the project requires. When assigning a team to a project, factors like the project timeframe and the developers' schedule are also held accountable.

##### 3. How do you take care of deadlines and the budget of the project?

Our project managers are responsible commitment realization within the approved [budget range](https://issart.com/blog/managing-the-software-development-budget/). This way, Client can be sure that the project team will make every effort to reach the business value.

To achieve this, a project manager takes care of the following:

- Project implementation plan with a necessary level of details;
- Project budget utilization plan which provides budget burndown understanding and predictable payment schedule;
- Project backlog containing all the tasks that should be performed during the project.

In addition, project manager's responsibilities include estimation and monitoring of risks in terms of budget and timeframes.

We never abandon projects unfinished or leave Client with unsolved issues; we always do our best to deliver the projects until the very end.

##### 4. Is your team located in one place?

Our software development teams are located in two cities â€“ Omsk (HQ) and Krasnoyarsk. For most of the projects we select a team from one city.

However, we provide high quality results despite of the team location. Our well-established communication practices allow us to achieve great results in the case of a distributed team structure as well. That is, we have projects where our team members are located in both Omsk and Krasnoyarsk, and Client's team is located abroad.

##### 5. Can we increase the scope of the project during the development process?

Time and Material model (hourly basis) is flexible. We can change the direction and the scope of work after each sprint.

For a fixed price model, an additional schedule to a contract should be signed and/or a new milestone should be initiated.

##### 6. Can you give me examples on how you support projects after the release?

We recently finished developing a mobile app for [power banks rental](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jetbrains.kotlin.mpp_app_android).

After the app launch and release to online markets, we received requests from Client to add new venues to Google maps and to test a bank card linking to the app. Our developers have clarified the task description with Client, and then proceeded to the task completion.

Such requests are usually addressed to a project manager who then assigns a developer from the team (who worked on a project) to complete the task.
