<span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are widely used in a variety of businesses. With opportunities they provide, it becomes possible to optimize processes and bring revenues to a new level.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is not an exception. Lots of companies are now looking for ways to cross-sell and up-sell effectively. This is where an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI based recommender system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey reports</span>](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown, 75% of content that Netflix users consume and 35% of products that Amazon users buy come from recommendations. After implementing a recommender system, Amazon reported a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">29% increase</span>](https://fortune.com/2012/07/30/amazons-recommendation-secret/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in sales. Alibaba group managed to drive the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">conversion rates by 20%</span>](https://martechtoday.com/roi-recommendation-engines-marketing-205787)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it applied </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML based recommendation algorithms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide shoppers with personalized offers during the sales festival in 2016.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, most online shoppers expect companies to provide them with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized recommendations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergage</span>](https://www.evergage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Evergage-2018-Trends-in-Personalization-Survey.pdf)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, 56% of users will come back to the sites that offer recommendations again and again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what kind of an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intelligent recommendation engine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to implement for your business? Or probably you are interacting with people who need to implement such a system? If any of these is the case, you definitely need to look through the possible use cases below.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Related products recommendations</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, a user has already purchased a hat. Why not offer buying a scarf that matches this hat, so that the look will be complete? This is about related products recommendations, and this use case is very popular among online stores. It is often implemented by means of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">machine learning algorithms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “Complete the look” or “You might also like” sections in online fashion stores like ASOS, H&amp;M, Pandora and many others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, such </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI based recommender engine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can analyze the individual purchase behavior and detect patterns that will help provide a certain user with the suggestions of products that will match his or her interests most likely. This is what Netflix actively applies when recommending movies and TV shows.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Alternative products recommendation</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it happens that a certain product is currently out of stock. This shouldn’t become a reason to let a user leave without any purchase. To prevent this, companies implement a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart recommendation system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which suggests alternative options. Check this example from Urban Outfitters.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with a feature for “notify me” when a product appears in stock again, such </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML based recommender engine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrates markable results. See the Skechers example below.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Location based recommendations</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">location based recommendation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> engine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is possible to detect customers who are nearby the physical stores or restaurants and send them an invitation to come in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Sephora sends the app users a push notification when they are nearby their store and offers them an incentive to come in (such as </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">free makeover</span>](https://taplytics.com/blog/location-based-push-notification-examples-ideas/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">). This approach certainly drives customer engagement and significantly increases chances that a user will finally make a purchase.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Recommendations on 404 page</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It happens sometimes that users encounter 404 error when browsing your website. Why not minimize the level of disappointment and provide something relevant there by applying a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalization engine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good idea is to display items that are similar to those he/she has recently checked on your site. Alternatively, you can show top products within certain categories. </span>

![personalized recommendations on 404 page](https://issart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Nike.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera offers a user to browse the course catalog on its 404 page.</span>

![Personalized recommendations on 404 page](https://issart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Coursera.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is to prevent a user from leaving the site with the feeling of frustration from not having found what he/she was looking for.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Recommendations of weekly/monthly top products</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recommending the top items is another popular tactic. This is what music streaming services actively apply when offering top charts and playlists. A well-known example of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">music recommendation engine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Discover Weekly</span>](https://www.spotify.com/discoverweekly/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Spotify.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we can see that embedding a system of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized recommendations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into online stores can not only boost sales. It can also increase customer satisfaction and retention level, so that a user will return to the online shop again and again.</span>
