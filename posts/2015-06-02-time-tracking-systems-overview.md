We’ve already covered various aspects of software development process so far: how to [choose a provider](http://www.issart.com/blog/outsourcing-software-development-choosing-right-provider/), which [IP issues](http://www.issart.com/blog/intellectual-property-issues-software-development/) to consider, how to [motivate your team](http://www.issart.com/blog/motivating-an-offshore-team/), what challenges to be aware of when working on [international scale](http://www.issart.com/blog/what-challenges-do-software-development-companies-face-while-working-with-foreign-customers/)… But how to make sure that the whole team is actually working? What if the majority of time is actually spent on non-project related activities (i.e. Facebook, chats with friends, etc.)?

### How to monitor the progress?

There is a solution for that – consider using time-tracking and project management software. These tools will help you a lot to stay involved in the development process and see the real picture of how things actually are on the project.

Time tracking tools together with project management software give you a great opportunity to measure your team’s performance. Right now our team is working on our own time tracking system – [CrISStal Eye](http://crisstaleye.com/) – which will be released in the nearest future. When designing this tool, we’ve tried to take into account everything we find useful to monitor performance on the project. You can check its features by visiting our website.

In this article we are going to focus on time tracking systems available on the market and review the most popular ones. In particular, we will compare these tools based on the criteria we consider to be the most important: integration with project management (PM) systems, built-in PM system, desktop client, activity monitoring, billing/invoicing, CRM, usability, and performance. These systems vary in their functionality significantly – from just tracking time spent to powerful integrations with accounting, ERP and CRM systems.

**Please note:** the review below represents the opinion of our team and is not aimed to advertise or bring into discredit any of the existing solutions.

#### [Timecamp](https://www.timecamp.com/)

**Integration with JIRA/Redmine**  
Jira: yes  
Redmine: yes

**Integration with other PM systems**  
• Trello  
• Asana  
• Podio  
• Pivotal Tracker  
• Basecamp  
• Assembla  
• Active Collab  
• TeamWork  
• Insightly  
• Freshdesk  
• Zendesk  
• OpenProject

**Built-in PM System**  
There is an opportunity to create “organizational structure”, to distribute employees among company departments, to assign tasks to employees.

**Desktop client**  
A desktop client is rather user-friendly. It enables to switch between two time tracking modes: manual and automatic. You can also create a new task and define its location in the project hierarchy.  
However, an issue with the speed of synchronization between the desktop client and the web application was noticed.

**Activity monitoring**  
There is an opportunity to monitor pages viewed in browser and time spent in applications. As for the screenshots – they are listed in features, but you will need to get in touch with the developers about this feature.

**Billing/invoicing**  
The invoicing system is rather flexible. Integration with Quickbooks allows to import all client’s data and taxes to TimeCamp’s invoicing module. Besides, the invoices created in TimeCamp will be exported to QuickBooks when sent to clients.

**CRM**  
There are customer database management features, including invoice generation and sending.

**Usability**  
Because of the rich functionality it may take some time to familiarize with the system.

**Performance**  
As mentioned above, there is an issue with the speed of synchronization between the desktop client and the web application.

**Author’s comments**  
TimeCamp is a multi-functional application with a variety of integrations. Project management and billing features are available. There is a flexible system for monitoring time spent by employees. The system allows creating a full organizational structure of the company. The visual calendar is very convenient, and it provides constant access to task management. It is also comfortable to view statistics on tasks.

#### [Hubstaff](https://hubstaff.com/)

**Integration with JIRA/Redmine**  
Jira: yes  
Redmine: yes

**Integration with other PM systems**  
• Active Collab  
• Asana  
• Basecamp  
• Breeze  
• GitHub  
• GitLab  
• Insightly  
• LiquidPlanner  
• Mavenlink  
• Pivotal Tracker  
• Podio  
• Producteev  
• Redbooth  
• Teamwork PM  
• Trello  
• Unfuddle  
• Wrike  
• Zoho Projects

**Built-in PM System**  
There is a possibility to select assignees for the particular tasks and to track time spent on this or that task. It is also possible to register many organizations and project team members.

**Desktop client**  
The desktop client has the majority of functions available in the web application.

**Activity monitoring**  
It is possible to set a number of screenshots taken in 5-minute interval.

**Billing/invoicing**  
It is stated that it is possible to export reports about completed tasks and spent time to Quickbooks. But in practice, apparently this feature is available only if the desktop version of Quickbooks is installed. In the web application the possibility to import into Quickbooks is limited to .csv and .xls formats only (while in HubStaff data export is done in .iif format). Moreover, seems like these reports do not logically coincide with the contents of Hubstaff reports.

**CRM**  
Integration with Quickbooks allows importing tracked time and paying employees and contractors or invoicing clients.

**Usability**  
Too much action is required when dealing with projects and reporting. Familiarization with user interface also requires some time.

**Performance**  
No delays in performance were noticed.

**Author’s comments**  
Hubstaff has rather rich functionality and good performance indicators. Meanwhile, integration with the only one accounting system is not as efficient as desired. The desktop client is not the most user-friendly one.

#### [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/)

**Integration with JIRA/Redmine**  
Jira: yes  
Redmine: yes

**Integration with other PM systems**

**Built-in PM System**  
Toggl has a simplified version of a built-in PM systems. What this system allows to you is to distribute the roles in the team and determine whether one person or the whole project team can be an assignee for this or that task.

**Desktop client**  
There is the version for Windows which is comfortable and functional enough to replace the work with the website.

**Activity monitoring**  
No

**Billing/invoicing**  
The system allows you to customize the rate for each assignee and to make task unbillable.  
However, the system cannot create templates for invoices, which is inconvenient for accounting. In general, the system is convenient only for the calculation of the efficiency of the time spent on this or that task.

**CRM**  
CRM system is absent as such. It is only possible to set the name of the customer when adding a new project.

**Usability**  
A very user-friendly interface.

**Performance**  
No delays in performance were noticed.

**Author’s comments**  
In general we can say that the target audience of the product is small independent companies with the following characteristics:  
• there is no need to conduct a complex documentation,  
• there is no multi-level accounting system,  
• project teams are small,  
• the level of trust to an assignee is high by default,  
• first and foremost, the tool is needed for an accurate tracking of time spent on a specific task.  
For a company of 20 – 30 people and above this product lacks planning tools severely; a more advanced CRM component is required. The system has a function of generating reports, but there is no way to generate an invoice for the work performed.

**Performance**

**Author’s comments**  
A user-friendly system of invoice creation. Double verification of the worked time sheets. Assigning an employee to a task (a project) is not very user-friendly. There is no desktop application.
