Natural language processing has been considered by most as an emerging technology under the subfield of artificial intelligence. It's the discipline of integrating and working on the relationship between computers and human language. It involves repetitive tasks such as summarization, ticket classification, machine transition, and more.

Since being founded in 2003, ISS Art has been striving to help the world's top companies and organizations turn their dreams into reality. Based in San Francisco, our team is filled with experts who can deliver bespoke solutions using artificial intelligence, software, and more.

Clutch's [2021 research shows](https://clutch.co/developers/artificial-intelligence/natural-language-processing) that ISS Art is the global leader in natural language processing. Clutch is a rapidly-growing B2B market research firm from Washington, DC. Their platform is hugely looked up to in the space for its data-driven content, client review directories, and its commitment to helping clients and service providers connect.

Each year, Clutch awards the best from different agencies, so it's massive news to us that we were recognized for our work. According to Clutch's Leaders Matrix, ISS Art is among the top 15 companies in this category.

Our dedication to this craft is paying off, and we are grateful for each and everyone who made this possible for us. We want to take this opportunity to advocate the importance of natural language processing and our work.

Our team wants to thank our clients who help us continue charging in the right direction. We appreciate their reviews on our Clutch profile. Their words serve as proof of our hard work and dedication to our clients.

*"ISS ART is extremely responsive and capable of resolving any development issue. They were just an email away if the site went down or a specific feature didn't function properly. Their consistent efficiency is why we engaged them for so long."* — CEO, Casting

*"I'd be out of business if it weren't for them. Maybe I could find someone else, but I don't think I'd be able to find someone better. We're small and we're just getting out of the startup phase, so if they hadn't done a good job, we might've failed as a business."* — Executive Director, Non-profit
