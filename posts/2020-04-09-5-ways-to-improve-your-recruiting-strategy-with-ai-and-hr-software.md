A recent study has shown that a lack of skilled talent is the top hiring challenge, as <u>[87% of HR professionals](https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2020/02/28/m-athe-war-for-talent.html)</u> say that there were few qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.

This is the reason why there’s currently a war for talent raging on, and companies have to go out of their way in order to attract and keep skilled people.

The screening and hiring processes are also complex and challenging. Companies receive avalanches of CVs for every vacant position, and it’s time-consuming to review every single one of them.

However, thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) and HR software, it’s much easier to find and hire the right person for the job.

## 1. Attract Ideal Candidates With Perfectly Written Job Postings

One of the most important and yet overlooked segments of the hiring process is coming up with a well-written and tailored job advert. That’s the first touchpoint your potential candidates will have with your brand, and it’s crucial to make a great impression.

AI-powered tools can assist you in getting this step right, and Textio is one of them.

In order to be able to generate accurate and high-quality copy for job posting, this tool collects and processes approximately 10 million job adverts every month. Its advanced algorithm analyzes and identifies some common keywords, phrases, and language patterns used in these adverts.

Then, with the help of natural language processing, this algorithm adjusts the language based on a particular industry and suggests the style and wording accordingly.

Besides this so-called augmented writing, meaning that humans aren’t removed from the process, Textio also has a huge database in which the outcomes of job postings can be tracked. In other words, this tool can identify the most effective adverts and make use of them.

## 2. Automate Your Sourcing Process

An abundance of recruiting sources is a true blessing. But, there’s a downside to it – this makes the sourcing process time-consuming and quite challenging.

Going through different social media platforms, job boards, and other channels in search of candidates can take days, not to mention you can accidentally overlook someone who’s a perfect fit for your company.

Powerful AI algorithms are capable of analyzing millions of social media profiles and scrutinizing them within a short timeframe. Moreover, their findings are accurate and detailed, so that you can start building your candidate pipeline and pack it with high-quality leads.

Besides this analytic task, AI-powered software can also send personalized messages to the candidates within the pipeline, thus keeping them engaged and interested.

## 3. Leverage Chatbots for Engaging Candidates

Conversational chatbots are known for their immense potential to improve communication between brands and their customers, but it’s not their only power.

Namely, they have made their way into the recruiting industry.

HR departments are responsible for keeping the lines of communication with applicants open and informing candidates about the progress of the screening and recruitment process. This usually consists of a number of repetitive, tedious, and low-value tasks.

Conversational chatbots can step in and automate a huge portion of the process. They can verify applications, answer applicants’ questions, and update them about the latest developments.

But, as the hiring process doesn’t end with picking the right candidate, chatbots can have another essential role – onboarding. Showing your new employees the ropes and training them for their new position is the final step of this cycle, and chatbots can significantly <u>[improve the employee experience](https://servisbot.com/hr-employee-chatbots/)</u>.

Your new hires can significantly benefit from these intelligent machines – instead of having to schedule onboarding sessions during the business hours, they can progress at their own pace and time with the help of chatbots programmed to offer them guidance.

## 4. Leverage Facial Expression Analysis

It’s not a secret that people tend to be insincere during job interviews.

While it’s ok to exaggerate a bit in order to present yourself in a positive light, lying is a big no-no. But, recruiters can’t always detect when candidates are bending the truth.

However, AI will put an end to this practice.

Unilever, a multinational corporation behind numerous popular brands, has been using <u>[facial expression analysis](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/ai-is-now-analyzing-candidates-facial-expressions-during-video-job-interviews.html)</u> in order to assess applicants’ honesty, mood, and personal traits.

The company allows candidates who find job openings on LinkedIn to apply for the position without having to provide their resumes. The first step they have to take is playing neuroscience-based games whose purpose is identifying their personalities, such as whether they tend to take or avoid risks.

After that, there’s a video interview, during which AI analyzes their facial expressions in an attempt to find the best match for the position. Finally, the software creates notes with observations about every candidate, which are then given to a human recruiter to complete the process.

This procedure is especially useful when it comes to hiring remote employees that you will most likely never have a chance to meet in person.

## 5. Customize Employee Value Propositions

Every company has a set of employee benefits and perks called an Employee Value Proposition (EVP).

Usually just a single set, and that’s a problem.

As brands are expected to personalize their offers for their customers, it’s only logical that they should do the same for their employees. Not everybody needs the same benefits, which means that the same set might work perfectly for one employee while being entirely disappointing for another one.

For example, although a bigger paycheck might sound like an ideal way to keep your employees engaged, in reality, <u>[only 25% of people](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/14/1823096/0/en/PayScale-Research-Shows-the-1-Reason-Employees-Quit-is-Pursuit-of-Higher-Pay-but-Money-Alone-May-Not-be-Enough-to-Attract-Talent.html)</u> leave their current job for more money. On the other hand, 27% of employees say that an opportunity to do more meaningful work is what prompted them to change jobs.

Given that the right benefits play an important role in boosting employee engagement, companies should be ready to customize their EVP and have more than one set available.

That’s where AI comes in to help companies analyze their candidates’ profiles on an individual level and determine what each of them would find appropriate in terms of benefits and perks. This way, candidates would be offered a tailored set of EVPs, thus increasing the odds of their job satisfaction and engagement.

Artificial intelligence can facilitate your candidate screening and recruiting process, and make sure that you conduct it properly. It’s possible to automate and improve the entire hiring journey so that both you and your applicants don’t waste time and resources.
