Since 2003, our company has been helping the world’s leading companies translate even their most complex objectives into stunning realities!

We focus on machine learning, data science, IoT solutions, and can code in a number of languages like Python, Java, C++, Swift and Kotlin. We firmly believe that your challenge is our inspiration, and we’ve successfully built solutions for the most challenging projects with that approach in mind.

In light of our contributions to the technology community, we’ve been named a top global leader in Custom Software Development as Clutch’s [online research shows](https://clutch.co/developers/artificial-intelligence). We’d like to take this time to thank our customers for participating in client reviews on our behalf, to gauge our impact on their businesses.

Almost all of our clients who left their reviews have given us five stars. We’re so happy to be meeting our clients’ expectations. Nevertheless, we know there is always a room for improvement, and we try our best to enhance our service by analyzing our performance, gathering feedback and taking corrective actions if needed.

For those who might not know, Clutch is a B2B ratings and reviews platform that employs a

unique formula to compare and contrast vendors across various industries. The Manifest, another B2B platform that [helps connect](https://themanifest.com/internet-of-things/companies#issart) buyers with verified vendors, names us a top IoT company. Visual Object, a site where companies can [add portfolio items](https://visualobjects.com/software-development/top-custom-software-developers/san-francisco) to their profiles to attract new businesses, lists us as a top custom software developer.

Thank you one and all for making this award possible!
